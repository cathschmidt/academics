				<h2>BFA candidate: Margaret Kearney</h2>
				<img src="../img/textiles/margaret-kearney.jpg"/>
				<p>
					"I really had no idea what it would mean to relate my environmental activism with my work in textiles, so it's been exciting to develop a process for myself." 

Margaret Kearney’s ability to weave formal and aesthetic concerns with her environmental activism won her national recognition as a Udall Scholar, a program that recognizes college students on the basis of their commitment to careers in the environment, health care or tribal public policy. In winning the scholarship – which is typically awarded to students majoring in science or environmental policy – Kearney became the first student from an art and design school to be recognized by the Udall Foundation since the awards were first given in 1996.

				<h2>John Terry: Department Head</h2>

				<p>
					A prolific independent filmmaker, John Terry has taught at RISD, Yale, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and MIT, where he was instrumental in founding MIT’s film/video program. For more than two decades, he has mentored RISD’s Film / Animation / Video students. “We develop the artist as a whole, "he shares, "so that he or she can continually adapt to the changing world. We’re teaching students how to look at new ways of understanding. If we don’t, as a society we’re condemned to a hopeless repetition of what we see on TV and in the movies.”

				<p>"The most important skill I learned at RISD was the ability to create a film from start to finish. I really learned how to become a filmmaker and think about all parts of the process – storytelling, animation, sound, how to be my own producer. This gave me a big advantage once I started working in the animation industry" </p>

					<h3 class="alumniName">Seth MacFarlane  ‘95 FAV / Producer + Director</h3>
					<p class="alumniDescription">
					 Add stand-up comedy and phenomenal voicing talents to his TV and movie work and it’s no wonder that Seth MacFarlane works overtime. He still writes, produces, voices and animates most episodes of Family Guy, the animated sitcom that continues to rank #1 with teenage males (based on his RISD senior film project, it made him the highest-paid TV exec ever). But Seth also pursues numerous other interests, from singing on a Grammy-nominated solo album of American standards to directing and writing the screenplay for his live-action feature film Ted — about a teddy bear with attitude — and hosting the 2013 Oscars.

					<h3>Ryan Trecartin ‘04 FAV / Video Artist</h3>
					<p class="alumniDescription">
					 Within five years of graduation, Ryan Trecartin had landed a trio of major awards, racking up more than $200,000 in art prizes. And it all started with his RISD senior degree project. After completing a 41-minute film called <em>A Family Finds Entertainment</em>, Ryan posted portions of it online, eager to share his work with anyone interested in watching. When artist Sue de Beer saw the film, she alerted a curator at the New Museum in Manhattan, who offered him an exhibition. Now based in Los Angeles and represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York City, Ryan shows his work all over the world. The New Yorker art critic Peter Schjedahl summed up Ryan's early success by proclaiming him "the most consequential artist to have emerged since the 1980s."

					<h3>Gus Van Sant ‘75 FAV / Film Director</h3>
					<p class="alumniDescription">
					 Audacity, wit, honesty and an incredible attention to detail have made Gus stand out as a director in Hollywood. At RISD his first encounters with avant-garde filmmakers inspired him to change his major from painting to film. Since then, he has managed to carve an interesting niche for himself, crafting both deeply unconventional independent films and mainstream crowd-pleasers. Following his 1985 debut — with the independent film Mala Noche — Gus has established himself as one of the most vital directorial voices in the US through films as diverse as <em>My Own Private Idaho</em> (1991), <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (1997), <em>Finding Forrester</em> (2000), <em>Milk</em> (2008) and <em>The Promised Land</em> (2012).
